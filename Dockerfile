# == Disclaimer ================================================================
# We are running the project's Docker image only for **local development
# purpose** (and not production + development). This image is not supposed to be
# working in OpenShift or other platforms that assign a random non-privileged
# user ID to run a container. Hence, when working with this image, it's more
# comfortable to rely on an existing user (when you log in the container, etc.)
# than a random one activated via an `entrypoint` (that is therefore not
# required here).
